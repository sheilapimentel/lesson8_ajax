### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JSON is a language-independent data format that was derived from JavaScript. It is a very common data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication.
2. AJAX allows web applications to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing web page.
3. XMLHttpRequest objext used HTTP to exchange data between a client computer and a web server. It can be used to request and receive data without reloading a web page.
